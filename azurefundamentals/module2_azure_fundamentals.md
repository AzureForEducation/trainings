# General vision

This self-service training intends to give you a more in-depth view of Microsoft Azure - Microsoft's public cloud platform. As you will be able to see, most of the content is sitting under a platform called "Pluralsight", one of the most widely used platforms for online technical training in the World.

Microsoft has partnered with Pluralsight on free online distribution of official Azure related content so, what this document does is to assemble all those contents to make your life easy on task to learn Azure.

> Note: Please, be advised that Pluralsight does require you to create (if you still don't have one) a new free account into their portal to get access to digital content.
